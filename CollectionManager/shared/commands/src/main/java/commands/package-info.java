/**
 * 
 * This package contains an abstract command class and related objects for
 * interaction with commands.
 * It can be used to implement the command pattern. Instead of the usual command
 * pattern, this implementation
 * provides static and dynamic access to command parameters, which can be useful
 * for commands with complex context.
